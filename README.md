Feel free to modify the numbers in each section to see how the number of 
pixels affects how the screen changes. Add whatever CSS elements you want 
to each section; you can also comment sections of the CSS out by using
command + / on a mac or control + / on windows. Observe as well whether the 
changes affect the target size and everything smaller, or if it affects the
target size and everything larger. Have fun!
